    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Communication changes lives — yet most people are never taught how to
      express themselves confidently. The Bright Talks Academy was created to
      bridge this gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work with students, professionals, and aspiring leaders who want to
      speak clearly, present confidently, and communicate with impact in
      real-world situations.
